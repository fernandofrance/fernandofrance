## Hello there

I don't really know how u got here, but I will try to show a little bit about myself for you.

My name is Luiz Fernando. I currently live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and my work is to solve problems. 
On my free time, I usually solve code challenges on platforms like HackerRank and LeetCode.

I'm currently studying about Javascript ecosytem, especifically the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js), i'm also learning about algorithms and data structures. Computational models are replacing math models in scientific inquiry and their impact is broad and far-reaching.
