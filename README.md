## Hello there

I don't really know how u got here, but I will try to show a little bit about myself for you.

My name is Luiz Fernando. I currently live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and my work is to solve problems. 
On my free time, I usually solve code challenges on platforms like HackerRank and LeetCode.

I'm currently studying about Javascript ecosytem, especifically the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js), i really enjoy working on these technologies and hope to get a job soon.
